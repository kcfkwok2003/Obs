# 雜記
## problem when run arduino

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'serial'
exit status 1
```
fixed by install pyserial:
```
pip install pyserial
```
still got another error:

```
jqy:1:10: fatal error: M5EPD.h: No such file or directory
 #include "M5EPD.h"
          ^~~~~~~~~
```
fixed by download M5EPD from git
```
https://github.com/m5stack/M5EPD.git
```
after download, got error:
```
E (3350) SPIFFS: mount failed, -10025
```
Change the partition scheme to "No OTA(1MB APP/3MB SPIFFS)" and run example SPIFFS_test
it pass
```

try another example: Button 
it got:

```
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
M5EPD initializing...OK
```

I found related issue in github:
[M5paper stuck in - M5EPD initializing...OK - loop #53](https://github.com/m5stack/M5EPD/issues/53)

change M5Stack board version from 2.0.6 to 2.0.4
and the button test pass

but spiffs still have problem, then go back to original 2.0.2

All seems ok
